//don't need to pass any types into login mutation because all it needs is the username and password
//search up inputs and what they do, instructor isn't clear
//we pass in a type to the register Mutation just so it isn't a huge block of code. it also required a return of a User
//queries are just getting data
//mutations make changes in our database
//required flags doesn't really mean it's required, just that those things have to be returned
